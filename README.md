I like to play around with Pythonmodules such as:

[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

> the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.

[secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html)

> The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

and more...

### Moral Believes
I consider every human inheriting great potential, only he or she capable of deciding which action to bestow. I don't expect the world to be perfect as well as me. Although considering to anticipate more from it in the context of human rights, i try my best to acknowledge the place i occupy and seek to put my tools into good use in terms of common good.
