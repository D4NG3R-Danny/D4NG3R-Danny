I like to play around with Pythonmodules such as:

[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

> the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.

[secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html)

> The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
> Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.

[Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home)
> Kivy - Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.
